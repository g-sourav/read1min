    <p><strong>What is ONDC?</strong></p>

    <p>Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a government-backed initiative in India that aims to create a level playing field for all players in the e-commerce sector. ONDC is based on open network protocols, which means that any company can participate in the network, regardless of its size or scale. This is in contrast to the current e-commerce landscape in India, which is dominated by a few large players.</p>
    
    <p>ONDC uses a number of different technologies, including <strong>AI and ML.</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Why Ondc?</strong></p>
    
    <p>ONDC has been gaining popularity in India because it offers a number of advantages over the current e-commerce system. First, ONDC is more inclusive, as it allows small businesses and sellers to participate in the market. Second, ONDC is more transparent, as it will be easier for consumers to compare prices and products from different sellers. Third, ONDC is more affordable, as it will reduce the cost of doing business for e-commerce companies.</p>
    
    <p>The government of India has set a target of launching ONDC by the end of 2023. Once launched, ONDC is expected to revolutionize the e-commerce sector in India and make it more accessible, inclusive, and affordable for all.</p>
