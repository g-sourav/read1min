    <p>A recent RTI query has revealed that the Reserve Bank of India <strong>(RBI) has lost Rs 88,000 crore</strong> worth of Rs 500 notes. The <strong>query was filed by activist Manoranjan Roy,</strong> who asked the RBI to disclose the number of Rs 500 notes that were printed by the three government mints in Bengaluru, Nashik, and Dewas, and the number of notes that were received by the RBI.</p>
    <p>The RBI&apos;s response to the RTI query revealed that a total of 8,810.65 million notes of Rs 500 were printed, but only 7,260 million notes were received by the RBI. This means that a <strong>total of 1,550.65 million notes, worth Rs 88,032 crore, are unaccounted for</strong>.</p>
    <p>The RBI has not yet clarified why these notes are unaccounted for. However, some experts have speculated that the notes may have been lost or stolen during the printing or transportation process. Others have suggested that the notes may have been deliberately diverted for illegal purposes.</p>
    <p>The revelation of the missing notes has raised serious concerns about the security of India&apos;s currency system. It has also led to calls for an investigation into the matter.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
    <p>The loss of Rs 88,000 crore worth of Rs 500 notes could have a number of negative impacts on India&apos;s economy. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>decline in the value of the rupee</strong>.</li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Increased inflation.</strong></li>
        <li>A <strong>slowdown in economic growth</strong>.</li>
        <li>A loss of confidence in the Indian banking system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Previous Similar Incidents in India and Other Countries</strong></p>
    <p>This is not the first time that there have been reports of missing currency notes in India.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;In 2016, the RBI admitted that it had lost Rs 14,000 crore worth of notes in the previous five years.</strong></p>
    <p>There have also been reports of missing currency notes in other countries.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 2017, the Bank of England revealed that it had lost &pound;800 million worth of notes in the previous five years.</p>
    <p>The revelation of the missing Rs 500 notes is a serious matter that needs to be investigated thoroughly. The government and the RBI need to take steps to improve the security of currency notes. The loss of currency notes can have a significant impact on Indian economy, and the government needs to take steps to prevent this from happening.</p>
